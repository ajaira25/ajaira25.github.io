            <p> One-Part Mold</p>
            <p> This assignment requires creating an open-back mold. Using silicon to create each mold, it requires about 6 hours for the process to dry out and create the mold. The mold for the open-cast was completed being of a vex-robotics gear andusing clear resin created a clear gear that only repliacted the properties of a gear on one side. The open-part mold was partially diffcult due to the leaking, but came out well. Anybody can create a open mold like this by first getting a small object. Second, build a box made out of cardboard, make sure it doesn't leak. Third, obtain two equal amounts of silicon and acryllic, then mix togther well. Foruthly, put the object on the bottom of the box, (glue iut down just in case) and pour the mixture. Finally, let the mixture dry for about 6 hours, open up the box, and ypu get the mold. To make the object, make the ,ixture again, but this time pour iunto the mold. Let the mixture dry and you get object.  </p>
