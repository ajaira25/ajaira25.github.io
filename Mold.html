            <p> Molding and Casting </p>
            <p> This assignment requires creating two molds, an open-back mold and a two-part mold. Using nylon to create each mold, it requires about 6 hours for the process to dry out and create the mold. The mold for the open-cast was completed being of a vex-robotics ger and right now the two-part mold of a little ping pong ball is in process. The open-part mold was partially diffcult due to the leaking, but came out well. Now after the two-part mold is the casting for each mold.</p>
