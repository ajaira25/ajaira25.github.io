            <p> The 3D scan was done on an iphone using scanerverse. The scan isn't the best though due to multiple issues. This includes the quality of the scan from the app, the lighting, and the process of scanning be possible to quick. This combines to a scan of a green water bottle that his clealry scanned in the front, but not so much in the back.FOr an optimal 3D scan, itis advised to get a better camera, porbally one actually used for this process. Secondly, do it in more consistent lighting area with noting interputting the image too. Finbally, due the scan on objects tat are relatively handheld since it can take a hwile on larger objects. The 3D print is a roller coaster based off the ones used in the first Spacemountain or the Matternhorn Bobsleds. It can be created using subtraction since the wheels are separated from the actual cart to roll. A very simple version is done by first doing a side sketch witha sloped front and the extruding it. Secondly, elimiante rectangluar space within the car, and holes off the bottom edge of the cart. Finally, create two thin singular bars that connect to the cart in the middle. On the bars create wheels that don't connect to the bar,with little caps to keep the wheels in place. This allows to a rolling cart if done right. </p>
