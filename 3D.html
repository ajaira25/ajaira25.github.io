        <div class="box-major-problem"> 3D Scanning and Printing
            <p> The 3D scan was done on an iphone using scanerverse. The scan isn't the best though due to multiple issues. This includes the quality of the scan from the app, the lighting, and the process of scanning be possible to quick. This combines to a scan of a green water bottle that his clealry scanned in the front, but not so much in the back. The 3D print is a roller coaster based off the ones used in the first Spacemountain or the Matternhorn Bobsleds. It can be created using subtraction since the wheels are separated from the actual cart to roll.</p>
